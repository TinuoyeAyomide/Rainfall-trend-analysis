Rainfall Trend and Variability Analysis (Kwara, Nigeria, 1990–2020)

This project explores 30 years of monthly rainfall data (1990–2020) in Kwara State, Nigeria to understand long-term rainfall trends and variability.  
It demonstrates how Python can be used for environmental and climate data analysis, which are skills that are valuable in hydrology, water resources, and climate change research.
